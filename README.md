Hackerrank Challenge

## Animal Inheritance
In this challenge, you will be asked to build on an abstract class and initialize an instance of each class with a variable.   The program will then test your implementation by retrieving the data you stored.

## Work Schedule
You just got a new job where you have to work exactly as many hours as you are told each week, working no more than a daily maximum number of hours per day. Some of the days, they tell you how many hours you will work. You get to choose the remainder of your schedule, within the limits.
